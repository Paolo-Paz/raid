# raid
This is under construction

RAID a tool for checking raid progress and hopefully some more cool stuff in the near future!
This requires Axios to function properly and a new file in your raid folder named config.js with the following code:
const config = {
    token: "*INSERT YOUR TOKEN HERE*",
}

module.exports = config;
Simply insert your Bungie API token and run npm install to install the dependencies required for this project from the root directory.
